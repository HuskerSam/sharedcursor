Planets without recent moons tidally lock (i.e. Mercury) with the Sun - resulting in hot and cold sides of the planet. The inner planets without moons acrete mostly heavier elements.",

This means ramping up rocket fuel production and advancing AI to track space objects. Once a galactic year the Copinerican System (our solar system) passes closest to the Milky Way black hole. This is when we can dump extra moons and need to fight off new arrivals.",
